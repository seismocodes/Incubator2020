This repository contains all files related to the codes developed during Winter 2020 Incubator project Daily monitoring of low-frequency earthquake activity and slow slip event occurrence.

## To run the code:

Install and activate environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate lfelib
pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ lfelib
